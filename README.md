Using netflix on a daily basis has made me realize, other than once in a while when I binge watch a new show, for the majority of the time
I keep rewatching the old shows, and I am paying 13 dollars monthly to rewatch these old shows, even tough I have the shows downloaded on an external Hard Drive, sometimes even seasons ahead of what netflix have.

And thus, I have come to realize the reason I am dependent on Netflix so much, is because of some key features:
1. Continous watching on any device
2. Ability to watch movies, in bad network condition, i.e. adaptive streaming
3. Personal Reccomendations and pleasnt GUI[not very important]

So the aim of this project is to have my own personal netflix, that can be run on android apps, and ios, windows or mac.

The following lists the current ability, and works in progress:
 1. [X] Partial Adaptive streaming(buggy)
 2. [X] Ability to watch on both mobile, and desktops, dynamic css. 
 3. [ ] Android App
 4. [ ] Iphone App
 5. [ ] Separation between dev and prod branches
 6. [X] Login/Signup
 7. [ ] Secure Login/Signup
 8. [ ] Separate admin log-in
 9. [ ] Continous Watching, i.e saving last watching track and time of track for a user
